# IA Submission Form

In order for your IA to be complete, you need to have a submission form. This is an HTML document. However, I have made this very easy for you. You don't even need to do any HTML. Instead, you need to run the python script `personalize_form.py` in a command terminal. It will open up the HTML, prompt you to add your personal components, and then write a brand new HTML document that is your submission.

A couple things to note: this form should be anonymous. Under student name, instead use your candidate number (I will provide that to you). Under school code, put `Made anonymous for IB submission`. Under user name, put `Student`. 

You should name your files in the documentation folder the following: `Crit_A_Planning.pdf` `Crit_B_Record_of_tasks.pdf` `Crit_B_Design.pdf` `Crit_C_Development.pdf` `Crit_D_Video_demo.wav/mp4/common video format` `Crit_E_Evaluation.pdf` `Appendix.pdf`.

Additionally your candidate name is going to look something like `abc123` , ask me for yours exactly. 

Finally the session number is `001518-xxxx` where I will give you the last four digits.  

After you are sure that you no longer need the generic form you can delete it. 

Your files should be in one of two folders. You should have all of your documentation in, unsurprisingly, the Documentation folder. That way the links from the HTML page will work. 

You should have the main component of your product in, unsurprisingly, the Product folder. 

After you have placed everything, open up the HTML in a web browser and be sure that the links work. 

Once everything is linked properly, you can then push everything to your IA repository. Everything should be clean and ready to be zipped and sent to the IB. 

Well done! Congratulations on completing your Computer Science IA!
